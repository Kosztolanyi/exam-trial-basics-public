# Tasks

## Symmetric matrix

```
Create a function named `isSymmetric` that takes an n√ón integer matrix (two dimensional array) as parameter
and returns true, if that matrix is symmetric (diagonally from top-left to bottom-right) or false if it is not.
```

Example 1:

```
[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 2, 2],
  [1, 2, 5],
]
```

Output:

```
true
```

Example 2:

```
[
  [7, 7, 7],
  [6, 5, 7],
  [1, 2, 1],
]
```

Output:

```
false
```

## Most Common Character

```
Write a function that takes a filename as a parameter.
Return the most common character of the file's content.
```

Example

[Example file can be found here](./countchar.txt)

Output

```
e
```

## Pirates

```
Write a program which can store pirates in a ship.

 Pirate:

 - It should have the following fields: name, gold, hasWoodenLeg, isCaptain and HP which is default 10.
 - You should create the following methods:

 - if a pirate is a captain:
    - `work()` which increase the gold by 10, and decrease the HP by 5.
    - `party()` which increase the HP by 10.
 - if not a captain:
    - `work()` which increase the gold by one, and decrease the HP by one.
    - `party()` which increase the HP by one.

  - the `info()` method returns a string which depends on the hasWoodenLeg field. 
 - If it's true, then the string should look like this:
    - Hello I'm Jack. I have wooden leg, and 20 golds.
 - If it's false:
    - Hello I'm Jack. I still have my real leg, and 20 golds. 
  
 Ship:

 - It should have a list of pirates.
 - You must be able to add new pirates to the ship. It should have only one captain!
 - You should create the following methods:
 - `getPoorPirates()` which returns a list of names containing the pirates that
    - have wooden leg and have less than 15 golds
 - `getGolds()` which returns the golds of all the pirates have.
 - `lastDayOnTheShip()` which calls the pirates `party()`.
 - `preparationForBattle()` which calls 
    - the pirates `work()` method five times
    - then the ships `lastDayOnTheShip()` method.

```
